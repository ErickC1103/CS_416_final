Ticket Master application 
Erick Cardenas
This is a web application that allows the user to search for tickets through the genre of the event and the city it resides in. 
The application has an authentication mechanism that allows users to login on their browser.
From there, a user may use the wishlist tab to manage events the user may want to save.
A dark mode was implemented to reduce eye strain.
